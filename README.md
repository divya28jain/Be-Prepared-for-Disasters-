# 🌍 Be Prepared for Disasters  
### An AR-Based Disaster Preparedness and Educational Platform  

---

## 🧩 Overview  
**Be Prepared for Disasters** is an Augmented Reality (AR) based platform that helps students learn how to respond effectively during natural and man-made disasters.  
The project transforms traditional, poster-based disaster education into interactive AR experiences that make learning engaging, safe, and memorable.  

This platform also integrates **LexAR**, an educational AR application that helps students visualize complex textbook diagrams and scientific models in real life — bringing learning to life through Augmented Reality.

## 🚨 Main Module – Be Prepared for Disasters  

### 🧠 Problem Statement  
Schools rely on manual drills and static posters to teach disaster preparedness. These methods often fail to engage students and lack practical experience.  
There is a need for an affordable, immersive, and interactive system that teaches students how to stay safe and calm during emergencies.  

### 💡 Proposed Solution  
- AR-based disaster simulations for real-time learning.  
- Gamified learning with badges, points, and challenges.  
- Step-by-step visual guidance during emergencies.  
- Region-specific content for localized disasters (floods, earthquakes, fires, etc.).  
- Digital drills and readiness tracking dashboards.  
- Emergency alerts and quick safety information integration.  

### ✨ Key Features  
- Interactive AR disaster training modules.  
- Teacher dashboards to monitor student preparedness.  
- Low-cost, smartphone-based deployment.  
- Offline-first design for rural and low-connectivity regions.  

### ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Unity (AR Foundation)** – AR app development.  
- **Blender** – Creation of 3D disaster visuals.  
- **ARCore / Vuforia** – AR tracking and device support.  
- **Firebase** – Data storage, progress tracking, and dashboards.  
- **Android / iOS** – Target deployment platforms.

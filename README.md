# 🌍 Be Prepared for Disasters  
### A Web-Based AR Platform for Disaster Preparedness and Education  

---

## 🧩 Overview  
**Be Prepared for Disasters** is a **web-based educational platform** powered by **Augmented Reality (AR)** that helps students learn how to respond effectively during natural and man-made disasters.  
The website transforms traditional, poster-based disaster education into **interactive, gamified simulations** that make learning engaging, safe, and memorable.  

The platform also integrates **LexAR**, an immersive AR learning app that allows students to visualize complex textbook diagrams and scientific models in their real environment — blending education and technology seamlessly.  

While the main interface is a **website**, users can also **install and access AR-based mobile apps** for extended learning experiences and simulations.
